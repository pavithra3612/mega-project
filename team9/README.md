# Team 10 Proposal: Water
## Abstract:

Lead service lines remain a major public health hazard across the United States. Many states still rely on old lead pipes that leach toxic metal(lead) into household water. This project focuses on visualizing the distribution of lead pipes nationwide, by using a dataset that reports the estimated number of lead service lines in each state. Because lead exposure is linked to serious health risks including: developmental delays, neurological damage, and cardiovascular issues understanding where these pipes are is critical. We will use state level lead pipe inventory data to build an interactive heat map of lead pipe concentrations. The expected outcome is a Streamlit application featuring a map of the U.S., allowing people to select a state and view its count of lead service lines, along with more information. This project will make the scale of lead infrastructure visible and accessible, helping communities, and water authorities realize the long term effects for public health.

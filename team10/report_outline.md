# ENG220 Project Report — Draft Outline

**Title:** Exploring the Relationship Between Walkability and Urban CO₂ Emissions  
**Author:** Prince Charmand Tsajio Tsague  
**Course:** ENG220 — Systems Thinking and Project Design  

---

## 1. Introduction
- Brief context on urban mobility and environmental impacts  
- Motivation: How walkable city design affects emissions  
- Research questions:  
  - How does walkability correlate with CO₂ emissions across cities?  
  - What are the effects of mode-shift scenarios (e.g., more walking, less driving)?  
- Overview of approach: dataset analysis + interactive scenario modeling  

---

## 2. Data & Methods
- **Datasets Used:**  
  - Primary: Urban emissions and commute datasets (Kaggle)  
  - Supplementary: Census or population density datasets  
- **Data Cleaning (Amir):** Handling missing values, normalizing units, variable standardization  
- **Analytical Methods:** Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, scenario modeling  
- **Tools:** Python (pandas, matplotlib), Streamlit app  

---

## 3. Results
- Key patterns from analysis (e.g., higher walkability → lower emissions)  
- Tables and figures (from Angok’s visuals)  
- Scenario outputs (interactive and static snapshots)  
- Summary of major findings  

---

## 4. Discussion
- Interpretation of results: what they mean for urban policy  
- Implications of mode-shift scenarios  
- Limitations and assumptions in the modeling process  

---

## 5. Limitations
- Dataset gaps or mismatches (Logan’s notes)  
- Modeling simplifications  
- Data representativeness (geographic or temporal coverage)  

---

## 6. Conclusion
- Summary of findings  
- Future research directions  
- Final thoughts on the impact of walkability  

---

## 7. References
APA or MLA formatted references (to be completed in Week 3).

## 8. Appendices
- Example datasets  
- Streamlit screenshots  
- Code references

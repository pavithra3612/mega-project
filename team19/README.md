Abstract:

With increasing world populations comes an increased demand for sustainable agriculture to
feed these massive populations. Climate change has also significantly impacted ambient
temperatures and precipitation rates, leading to unstable weather conditions, leading to
significant challenges for agriculture as a whole. New Mexico in particular has been
suffering from increasingly severe droughts which, in the long term, could lead to massive
water shortages and, thus, agricultural collapse.
The goal of this project will be to analyze the effects of climate change on agriculture around
the world, and, potentially, in New Mexico. Correlations between changes in temperature,
irrigation, CO2 emissions, and crop yield will be compared and observed across the past
thirty years. These data correlations will be included in the ECE 220 dashboard to help
educate the population of the severity of the situation, and potentially inspire action to save
the environment.

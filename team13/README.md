Project Proposal Plan – California Housing Prices 9/25/2025

  We aim to build a system that will focus on using data to predict the prices of housing in
one of the most diﬃcult areas to own a house, California. We choose this project as in recent
Dmes the prices of the housing market significantly went up and among one of the places most
eﬀected was California. Most of the homes in California are much older being built around the
1950s and 1960s in the more populated areas. The problem that we wish to accomplish is to try
to preserve and make housing aﬀordable and oﬀer ways to increase the housing market in order
to draw down prices and house insecurity. Our goal is to predict and use data to determine the
median house values in selected California counties.

  This system will take into account the average median income, house ages, number of
rooms/ bedrooms, occupancy, population, location, and the longitude/ latitude. The chosen
dataset is suitable for the project as it has 20640 entries and it measures and includes the
necessary data about the houses in the area. The main impact that this project should have is to
increase awareness and discover soluDons using data.

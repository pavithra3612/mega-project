# Key Findings for PowerPoint Presentation
## Crime and Incarceration Analysis - New Mexico Focus

---

## 🎯 **MAIN FINDING: The New Mexico Paradox**

**New Mexico has the HIGHEST crime rate in the nation (2016) but only average incarceration rates.**

This creates a **disconnect** between crime levels and incarceration policies - a perfect topic for your "Access to Justice" presentation!

---

## 📊 **Slide 1: The Shocking Statistic**

- **New Mexico ranked #1 in crime rate (2016)** - Highest in the entire United States
  - Crime Rate: 4,628 per 100,000 population
  - National Average: 3,409 per 100,000
  - **32.9% HIGHER than national average**

- **But incarceration rate is only #30** - Middle of the pack
  - Incarceration Rate: 335 per 100,000
  - National Average: 396 per 100,000
  - **17.2% LOWER than national average**

**Key Question:** Why does the state with the most crime have relatively low incarceration rates?

---

## 📈 **Slide 2: Trends Over Time (2001-2016)**

### Crime Rate Trend:
- **2001:** 5,319 per 100k
- **2016:** 4,628 per 100k
- **Change: -13.0%** (Crime is DECREASING)

### Incarceration Rate Trend:
- **2001:** 310 per 100k
- **2016:** 335 per 100k
- **Change: +8.4%** (Incarceration is INCREASING)

**The Paradox:** Crime went DOWN 13%, but incarceration went UP 8.4%!

This is the OPPOSITE of what you'd expect if incarceration was directly responding to crime.

---

## 🔍 **Slide 3: The Divergent Trend Pattern**

**19 states show the same pattern:** Crime decreased but incarceration increased

Examples:
- **Arizona:** Crime DOWN 42.9%, Incarceration UP 17.1%
- **Arkansas:** Crime DOWN 7.1%, Incarceration UP 24.3%
- **Florida:** Crime DOWN 44.2%, Incarceration UP 7.3%

**This suggests systemic issues beyond just responding to crime levels.**

---

## 📉 **Slide 4: Correlation Analysis**

**Overall Correlation: 0.432** (Moderate correlation)

- This means crime and incarceration are related, but NOT strongly
- Many factors beyond crime rates influence incarceration
- **Policy, resources, and justice system efficiency matter more than crime alone**

---

## 🗺️ **Slide 5: Regional Comparison (Southwest, 2016)**

| State | Crime Rate | Incarceration Rate |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **New Mexico** | **4,628** | **335** |
| Arizona | 3,472 | 612 |
| Nevada | 3,261 | 474 |
| Texas | 3,193 | 542 |
| Colorado | 3,095 | 352 |
| Utah | 3,218 | 148 |

**Key Insight:** New Mexico has the highest crime but NOT the highest incarceration in the region.

Arizona has 25% less crime but 82% MORE incarceration!

---

## 📊 **Slide 6: Incarceration-to-Crime Ratio**

**New Mexico Ratio: 0.072** (Rank: #47 out of 50)

This means: **For every 1,000 crimes, only 72 people are incarcerated**

**States with highest ratios (most incarceration per crime):**
1. Idaho: 0.217 (217 per 1,000 crimes)
2. Connecticut: 0.206
3. Delaware: 0.203

**New Mexico incarcerates at less than HALF the rate of high-ratio states, despite having the highest crime rate.**

---

## 💡 **Slide 7: Key Insights for "Access to Justice"**

### 1. **The Efficiency Question**
- High crime + low incarceration = Are crimes not being solved/prosecuted?
- OR = Is the system focusing on rehabilitation over punishment?

### 2. **The Resource Question**
- Does New Mexico lack resources for prosecution/incarceration?
- OR = Are resources being allocated differently?

### 3. **The Policy Question**
- Are New Mexico's justice policies more lenient?
- OR = Is there a disconnect between crime reporting and justice system response?

### 4. **The Regional Disparity**
- Why does Arizona (similar region) incarcerate 82% more with 25% less crime?
- What can we learn from different state approaches?

---

## 🎯 **Slide 8: Recommendations & Questions for Discussion**

### Questions to Explore:
1. **Is low incarceration a problem or a solution?**
   - Could it reflect under-resourced justice system?
   - OR progressive policies focusing on alternatives?

2. **What explains the disconnect?**
   - Resource constraints?
   - Policy differences?
   - Data reporting differences?

3. **What can other states learn?**
   - Can high-crime states maintain lower incarceration?
   - What policies work best?

### For Your Presentation:
- **Visual:** Show the scatter plot of crime vs incarceration (New Mexico as outlier)
- **Visual:** Timeline showing crime decreasing while incarceration increasing
- **Visual:** Map showing New Mexico as #1 in crime but #30 in incarceration
- **Visual:** Comparison chart with Southwest states

---

## 📝 **Talking Points Summary**

1. **New Mexico is #1 in crime but #30 in incarceration** - This is unusual and worth investigating

2. **Crime decreased 13% but incarceration increased 8.4%** - Shows incarceration doesn't directly track crime

3. **19 states show same pattern** - This is a national trend, not just New Mexico

4. **Moderate correlation (0.432)** - Many factors beyond crime influence incarceration

5. **Regional disparities** - Similar states handle justice very differently

6. **Access to Justice implications:**
   - Are crimes being properly addressed?
   - Are resources adequate?
   - Are policies effective?

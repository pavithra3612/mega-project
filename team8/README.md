 Abstract: 
One of the major issues regarding access to healthcare is the availability of hospitals and their accessibility by proximity. A major issue primarily faced in rural areas is the lack of proximity to a hospital. Especially in New Mexico, where we have a lot of rural areas and tribal land that are an average of 1-3 hours away from hospitals. Additionally, we have only one trauma 1 hospital in New Mexico, which is UNM Hospital. Overall, this is an issue that plagues many rural areas in the United States. There is an extreme need for government help and aid to support the building of more hospitals and access to healthcare. There is also a need for cheap and quick ways to sustain life while patients are being transported to UNM Hospital or an emergency room close by. Not only is there a lack of hospitals and cheap healthcare, but there are also short-staffed areas. One of the solutions that we feel can counteract these issues is a combination of more telehealth and mobile health clinics. We should have doctors on call for video healthcare, along with mobile health clinics being put in many different rural areas with access to insulin, antibiotics, and in-field medical training. 

Possible Solutions: 
Telehealth expansion, AI doctors, mobile health clinics, free health care, and more affordable medical school.

Ryan Derek Meier
	Contribution: Data Cleanser/Analyst Engineer - Responsible for cleaning the data that we will use for the final project. Analizing the data and making sure that it looks correct and is usable in the way we want it. Then responsible for making any of the charts or graphs that we would like to use for the final project. 


Isaiah Angle Buckles
	Contribution: I will be the main researcher of the group. I will provide data to the data analyst as well as research to the slides maker. I will help around as well.


Vladislav Ericovich Debelak
	Contribution: I will be creating a basic script of what we will discuss in our video. It will not be a word for word script but more of a list of bullet points that highlights our key ideas and will let each person elaborate on all of our main ideas. I will also be in charge of the flow of our video, deciding what topics will make most sense discussing when and where. This will be important in making our video clean and clear.



Elijah Antonio Chavez:
	Contribution:  I'm creating the slideshow for our presentation. I will make sure to include detailed, relevent and percise information that we, as a team, will be able to present effectively. 


Conclusion: The goal of this project is to hopefully make healthcare more accessible to people who are not in close proximity to any major hospitals/health clinics through the applications of telehealth expansions and mobile health clinics. As a team we are DRIVEn to make this happen.

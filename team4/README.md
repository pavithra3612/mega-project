# team-4-project-ENG220
ENG220 Final Group Project Repository

Project Abstract:
  Our group’s assigned topic was violence and security. In light of many recent events, violence and security is a very prominent topic, especially gun violence. Because of this, our group was particularly interested in forming our project around gun-violence related crimes and their potential solutions. We were able to find a suitable dataset on Kaggle called “Gun Violence Data,” which records over 260,000 gun violence incidents with as many details as possible. This data is well-suited for our project since it is relatively recent (as recently as 2018), and contains many categories. While it might be hard to find a complete solution to gun violence that avoids political opinions, it is possible to brainstorm peace-engineering-focused solutions based on our dataset. This project will likely not have any direct impact itself, but it will make many people more informed about the prevalence of gun violence, and hopefully inspire future engineers to keep these ideas in mind as they strive to create peace.

Team Contributions:
  Ben Anyanonu - Prime Minister: Assisting Managing Github workflow, planning project report, managing team progress on project.
  
  Max Aragon - Managing Github Workflow, dataset research.
  
  Sebastian Gardiner -  Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  
  Avery Portillos - Research and verify sites and sources are credible.

  All members: Writing documentation and project report, filming 1-2 minute video segment.

Final Conclusion, Project Outcomes:
  We hope that the outcome of our project will be sparking ideas of change in the minds of our fellow engineers. We live in a very violent city, so the topic of violence is quite prevalent, and a topic that all of us will need to be mindful of as we begin work as engineers. Though it may not be possible to solve the problem of violence in Albuquerque, it is possible for engineers to implement ideas that help prevent violence.
